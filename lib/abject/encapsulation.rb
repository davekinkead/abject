  # The idea behind encapsulation is to keep the data separate from the code. This is sometimes 
  # called data hiding, but the data is not really hidden, just protected inside another layer 
  # of code. For example, itâ€™s not a good practice to scatter database lookups all over the place. 
  #
  # Encapsulation can also be achieved through the use of protected functions.  The importance 
  # of function safety cannot be stressed enough.  Unprotected methods result in data spillage, 
  # tight object coupling, and other morally questionable behaviours.
  #
  # Only Abject can 100% guarantee that your code can't be reached.  Trust nothing else.
